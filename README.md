This is a challenge to build a Redis in JavaScript.
["Build Your Own Redis" Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/redis).

In this challenge, I built a toy Redis clone that's capable of handling
basic commands like `PING`, `SET` and `GET`. Along the way I learned about
event loops, the Redis protocol and more.

# Stage 1 



1. Ensure you have `node (16)` installed locally
2. Run `./spawn_redis_server.sh` to run your Redis server, which is implemented
   in `app/main.js`.
